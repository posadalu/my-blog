Drastic change either makes or brakes a small business. The pandemic has proven without a doubt that risk assumptions that business make can fly out of the window any minute, is impossible to prepare for everything.

So when drastic change happens outside our predict risk scenarios, the only business that can thrive forward are those which are adaptable. 

According to [HBR](https://hbr.org/2011/07/adaptability-the-new-competitive-advantage), organisation can no longer rely on static competitive advantages such as position in the market or scale. That has never been more relevant. 

The pandemic was tough, no matter the size of the business or organisation for months the world was halted. Now, companies instead of focusing at being really good at one thing, they need to focus also in being really good at learning new things. 

Yet, what does it really mean to become a more adaptable company and how is that achieved? 

## Understanding Adaptive Organisations

The more you scale, the harder it is to be adaptable. Bureaucracy is a barrier towards adaptability because it limits the ability to pivot. 

For startups pivots are part of the game, in fact they are the whole game. Eric Reis' [The Lean Startup](http://theleanstartup.com/) emphasis greatly that the lean methodology is not just for startups but for all organizations even departments in big companies. 

That is one of the places where Adaptive Organizations is used to describe companies that can build, reflect, analyse and learn in order to turn mistakes into data for future success. This frees you to try 'new endeavours' with less risk, because the learning is extremely valuable as real-time data. 

Another concept to understand about Adaptive Organizations is the [test-and-learn model](https://www2.deloitte.com/global/en/pages/human-capital/articles/the-adaptable-organization.html), which emphasis the need for very flexible, autonomous processes which free the individuals in the organisation to adapt effectively to drastic change. 

## Calibrate Your Culture

If your idea of culture is limited to a ping-pong table and cocktail Fridays, there might a lot more adjustments to be done. Culture is the set of values, and adaptability needs to be part of that equation. The reason culture important is because it sets rewards, goals, collaboration methods, compensation, feedback and much more. Your culture needs to reward adaptable individuals. 

Due to the pandemic, and newly tried remote workplace efforts, employee engagement took a slight tool before returning to the normals. Yet it is still low, sitting at 51% as employees who are "not engaged" according to [a Gallup study.](https://www.gallup.com/workplace/321965/employee-engagement-reverts-back-pre-covid-levels.aspx?utm_source=workplace_newsletter&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=workplace_newsletter_oct_10202020&utm_content=view_2020_trend_cta_2&elqTrackId=570a4187e5bb4fd288febdb17bdb0d1b&elq=a5ab693b00a646ee9378cdf64d27a1ed&elqaid=5319&elqat=1&elqCampaignId=1100)

Your calibration would mean creating incentives and an ecosystem that values adaptive experts more than domain specialist. *Adaptive Expertise* is a learning theory with many benefits to businesses, and it can be a high value for you culture. Adaptive expertise is someone who is not restricted to a domain specialty, but they have skills which are transferable and adaptive to different type of problems. 

The world post pandemic is moving towards [requiring organisations to be more adaptable](https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/wellness/adaptability-coronavirus-skills/2020/05/26/8bd17522-9c4b-11ea-ad09-8da7ec214672_story.html). One of the ways you accomplish that is by making adaptive experts the new normal at your organisation, employees are assumed to be adaptable to a constantly changing world with problems outside their normal domain.

One way of encouraging adaptive expertise is by providing your team with constant learning opportunities. Learning is a great way to boost engagement in your company. A TELUS study showed that [68% of employees](https://www.telusinternational.com/articles/the-surprising-key-to-long-term-remote-working-productivity) valued continued learning opportunities 

## Moving Forward

The pandemic has been very difficult for everyone, and for SME it has involved a lot of valiant adaptations. 

We need to make that mindset the new normal in the cultural fabric of our organizations, that way when risk management fails to protect us from unforeseeable events, it is our adaptability that kicks in and helps us succeed. 

Best of luck, and stay adaptable.
