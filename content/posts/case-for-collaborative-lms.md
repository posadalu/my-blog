You graduate from school and work forty years in your profession until you retire and move to Florida to enjoy the beachside breeze. Sounds like your envisioned future? It might depend on you age. That's for certain a difficult outlook for anyone not currently earning millions. Michelle Weise in her book breaks down how the future employee will most likely work 60 to 80 years, and that's not that much in the future. That's not a SciFi predicition, although that would make for a very flat but realistic SciFi story.

There is an anxiety in this for a lot of us youngsters, an anxiety of how uncertain the future looks. It makes short-term decisions a lot more difficult and heavily-weighted. Decisions like what degree to major in, or what should my first job experience be. We have to consider will this even exist in a few years, and will it give me skills I can use to then re-skill into a different job. Universities are losing their appeal, some say because it ain't applicable enough and then solutions like bootcamps pop up. Bootcamps make it easier for people to reskill or upskill although terribly expensive, especially if you are going to have to do one every twenty years in your career. 

The internet is full of information for the adventurous DIYer. That's a treacherous route to which we have not only never been trained for but almost been untrained for by years of centralized, strictly structured schooling. 

That's why I am fixated and spend hours a day breaking my head on an idea that is so far fetched yet I believe so important. A space, or a collection of spaces, that allow people in the spirit of open-source collaboration to curate, create and collaborate learning experiences. 

I think it should be easier, and free for me to go somewhere in the internet and have a clear picture of the current state of knowledge in any given field. To benefit from many people much more advanced in their learning knowledge in that field through the form of advice, answers, and oral lessons finally written down. And yet, to not be just a passive participant but to also even from my limited perspective bring forth whatever possible in order to be active in my learning. This could be done by collaborating with learners at different levels in creating projects, or even contributing in the curation of relatable knowledge. Then I could cnstantly be growing and learning in different fields, being active and partcipating in my own learning all for free. I could also showcase this learning initiative to employers as a form of recognition of my abilitiy to be adaptable and grow through lifelong learning skills. A portfolio of my learning of sorts. 

I think this could benefit students, researchers and professionals by giving them a space to collaborate in what they love. I envision this as Hubs, a place where everyone is a knowledge seeker and bearer.
