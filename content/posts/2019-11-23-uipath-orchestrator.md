It seems almost too easy to fall into apathy nowadays. It means something along the lines of lack of care, lack of suffering or lack of enthusiasm. It can also bee seen as the lack of empathy, or opposite of empathy. Sometimes that is how I feel about life and it does make it very difficult to make sense of life. When I mean make sense of life I mean understanding what purpose and meaning look like in life from a secular perspective, without any spiritual underpinning, simply in the world as we understand it, what does it mean to be alive.

Don't even get me started on COVID19 and how much more difficult that made it to feel connected to the world and mantain a healthy state of mind.

Look at this:

I got tired of waking up feeling sluggish, what Adam Grant so perfectly referred to as languishing. I started to seek answers in YouTube, friends, books and a ton of blogs. Some were hits and some misses, but I found the most important part was simply doing the entire process. Digging deeply to find what questions I had, and looking for answers. I found that simoply searching the internet and books was isolating and di not help as much. It was when I combined it with talking with friends and sometimes strangers that I felt most engaged.

The problem I then faced is I had too much information, some that overlapped greatly and sometimes contradictions that were hard to put together. Alan Watts' take on Taoism and the Tao Te Ching, Cornel West, Eckhart Tolle, Carl Jung, Arendt, Viktor Frankl, Meditations by Marcus Aurelious among other stoic works, more naunce thinkers like Noam Chomsky, Matt Haig's fictions, Jordan Peterson, etc. All of this was powerful and at times difficult to draw my own conclusion.

That's what I do in this blog, explain how I make sense of life based on everything I learned over the past year in a way that is honest to me and plausible to follow.

# Life is a blank canvas

It took me a little bit of time, and a lot bit of unlearning to really understand this. Life had always without a question been about being on the right side, finding success, achieving all the good things, among other very well prescibed dogmas. It was a while back that I read Sapiens and it got me thinking about what it means to be human. Within that line of thought all of this concepts like good, right and success started to fall apart. That was scary and it often made me feel more apathetic about life. Why should I care about a life where there is no right or wrong. 

This second time around I saw the upside of the same perspective. Life is like a blank canvas, which can be terryfiying but is also an opportunity to paint however you want. Much like painting there is no strict rubric it really is up to the artist to bring the art. This was beautiful for me because it meant that the artist/painter was very important in determining the direction.

Life is like a box of chocolate, if you leave it out and don't eat it it'll melt and go to waste.
