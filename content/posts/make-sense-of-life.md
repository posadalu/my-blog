It seems almost too easy to fall into apathy nowadays. It means something along the lines of lack of care, lack of suffering or lack of enthusiasm. It can also bee seen as the lack of empathy, or opposite of empathy. Sometimes that is how I feel about life and it does make it very difficult to make sense of life. When I mean make sense of life I mean understanding what purpose and meaning look like in life from a secular perspective, without any spiritual underpinning, simply in the world as we understand it, what does it mean to be alive.

Don't even get me started on COVID19 and how much more difficult that made it to feel connected to the world and mantain a healthy state of mind.

Look at this:

I got tired of waking up feeling sluggish, what Adam Grant so perfectly referred to as languishing. I started to seek answers in YouTube, friends, books and a ton of blogs. Some were hits and some misses, but I found the most important part was simply doing the entire process. Digging deeply to find what questions I had, and looking for answers. I found that simoply searching the internet and books was isolating and di not help as much. It was when I combined it with talking with friends and sometimes strangers that I felt most engaged.

The problem I then faced is I had too much information, some that overlapped greatly and sometimes contradictions that were hard to put together. Alan Watts' take on Taoism and the Tao Te Ching, Cornel West, Eckhart Tolle, Carl Jung, Arendt, Viktor Frankl, Meditations by Marcus Aurelious among other stoic works, more naunce thinkers like Noam Chomsky, Matt Haig's fictions, Jordan Peterson, etc. All of this was powerful and at times difficult to draw my own conclusion.

That's what I do in this blog, explain how I make sense of life based on everything I learned over the past year in a way that is honest to me and plausible to follow. 

The easiest way for me to stay true to this belief was to remember it in the form of a cliche metaphor. Life as a canvas & I am the painter. It is cliche but powerful and easy to remember and repeat to myself when I am down. This as opposed to life as a jigsaw puzzle where we are trying so hard to find the right pieces to complete this very specific picture. Let me explain it.

# Life is a blank canvas

It took me a little bit of time, and a lot bit of unlearning to really understand this. Life had always without a question been about being on the right side, finding success, achieving all the good things, among other very well prescibed dogmas. It was a while back that I read Sapiens and it got me thinking about what it means to be human. Within that line of thought all of this concepts like good, right and success started to fall apart. That was scary and it often made me feel more apathetic about life. Why should I care about a life where there is no right or wrong. 

This second time around I saw the upside of the same perspective. Life is like a blank canvas, which can be terryfiying but is also an opportunity to paint however you want. Much like painting there is no strict rubric it really is up to the artist to bring the art. This was beautiful for me because it meant that the artist/painter was very important in determining the direction. 

# Us as painters

I suck at painting, everything I try looks like it was made by a very untalented five year old. Yet the metaphor here is to remind me that only I can paint over this canvas and leave my unique style of art.

Think Bob Ross. That guy made the canvas his life and life his canvas, and the way he slapped the brush back and forth to dry it was a stroke of genius (get it). Now the problem is when you want to be like Bob Ross, because no one can but you try and try hoping that way you can call yourself a great painter and end up with a well painted canvas. You can only paint the way you can, of course you will be influenced by many people in your life but ultimatly you are the one stroking the brush accross the canbvas with every decision you make. 

A note on mistakes, because often we might feel caught up in regret. What if you messed up and painted with the wrong shade or too much or too little. I think that's the window for real genius in a painter, turning every single thing painted on the canvas into something unique and complimentary to the rest. I mean look at Jason Pollock, that guy was just throwing black paint at his canvas and it resonated with some therefore genius. I bet he didn't regret any of his splashes of paint, even if some 'could have' been better.

# How to judge a painting instead of a jigsaw puzzle

I think too often we see life as a jigsaw puzzle with a clear picture at the end and we try so hard to fit the pieces. In this metaphor, the picture we create as we grow up thanks to pressure created from family, culture, society, teachers, social media, etc, etc. Ten we have this picture and we work so damn hard to complete it thinking it has to be the right way. Daniel Sloth, the comedian, has a great little bit about something like this. Similarly to trying to paint by just immitating a great piece of art by someone else. 

The rubric to success here is strict, and I think it too often leads to dissapointment for the regular layman like you and I. Some have a knack for it, and piece together the jigsaw or immitate the artwork without too much trouble; sometimes those same people are left feeling unrepresented or unsatisfied by what they created, something that is not theirs.

So how do you judge free will painting, or in other words, how do you judge your life when it is a blank canvas and you have no rules to follow. 

I think that the matter is quite simple. Of course there are ideas of what a good, original painting looks like and it is based in the collective subjectivtiy of the current society. In life we have ideas of successful people that differ a lot form a few years back and a lot more from a few centuries back. Our idea of a good painting, thereof a good life, is dependent on the current 'mood' of society.

However, painting just to meet those standards might leave you a bit disheartened. I think, and I very much could be wrong, that if you get so caught up in this you might find out that at the end the painting you created was not at all what you actually desired although maybe considered good and successful. 

I would judge your painting, by following two principles that must go hand-on-hand keeping each other accountable:

By constantly checking inwardly to make sure that every stroke that you paint in that moment feels like the right choice. Now that might sound fluffy, and I know some struggle with what does it even mean to make the right choice. This idea of go with gut needs to be explored more and I want to do that in a different post. What I mean in this case is making sure that when you add a new stroke to the canvas, that in that moment it feels like the right one. When you make a choice for your life that it feels correct in the now. 

The principle above is kept in check with the second principle, which is to study the paintings of other people not for the sake of copying but for the sake of understanding what type of painting styles, colors, brush sizes, (enter more metaphorically appropiate painting references) feel good to you so you can learn them. This is different than copying someone elses painting or just painting to satisfy the criteria of success, this is about not silating yourself from the world and learning from others. For life that means being connected to different communities, always learning and reflecting on how what you learned applies to your life. 

Life is a blank canvas does not mean that you need to start from blank. We can learn and grow from others and their lives, to then help us guide our decisions better. The balance between being honest to ourselves about what we want in the now, and learning from others on their methods is one that I believe can help you make better (albeit difficult) choices in your life. 

# Peace of Mind

It was through Taoism and Alan Watts that I relearned what the Ying&Yang ☯ stand for, seeing it in my life this idea not of contradiction but of complimentary opposites. The metaphor of painting our blank canvas for me is all about that. Life is a blank canvas does not mean it has to be depressing because there is no set path to follow, it can mean endless opportunities. Those endless opportunities can create an overwhelming of what are the right/wrong choices to make, because although in art their rarely is right or wrong the concepts are still part of us and we want to form our own in order to judge our own life. That's why the complimentary opposites of doing what feels right to you in the moment and harnessing the learning from others choices is the answer to that for me. That way we can make choices that feel right to us, yet through our endeavour of learning about others and life itself we shape our conception of right/wrong so it is more calibrated. 

A warning is to make sure you don't fall into the trap of copying or being dishonest to yourself instead of learning from other. Ignorance is a bliss because it can make the first part, doing what feels right, so much easier as that's all you know. Yet ignorance is hard in a day where everything is so interconnected and we are exposed to so much through social media and our communities. So embrace the learning of other people and their eprspectives in life but do not confuse it for a rubric of what your life or choices should be like. 

**Also, random quote of the day:**
```
Life is like a box of chocolate, if you leave it out and don't eat it it'll melt and go to waste.
