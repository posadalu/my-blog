`change isn't easy`

It is easy to see the world from an optimistic perspective and quickly see the pessimistic side. We can get excited about AI and the power of automation, and then realize that it might cost us our jobs or they might take over the world and Will Smith will be too old by then to save us from the robots.

Optimistic or pessimistic outlooks of the future lead me to a similar conclusion, we really don't have the capacity to predict and understand the future.

Sure, it is fair to assume blockchain, AI, virtual reality, EV, and other technologies will in some way play a role in our lives fifty years from now, but you'd be a speculative fictionist by trying to figure out how much. I'd argue the speculative fiction plays a bigger role in shaping the future more than predicting it. The technologies might all exist in the future and be integrated at greater extents than what they are now, but by how much and how have they affected all the intangibles of society around them seems at this point impossible to figure out as it has always been (unless someone invents the technology to figure that out).

Intangibles I mean things like how integrating a technology, take AI for example, into our everyday lives will affect the cultural framework of our society. Sure some visionary enough could way before telling the internet of things and mobile devices were within the horizon, but it is much harder, nearly impossible, that they predicted the effects it had in culture and mental health among many other intangible effects.

Also if you do follow futurists, those who do this as a serious predicament of the future, not a speculative novel hoping to give society insight of their own reality through future realities, you quickly realize that they are just cliche fiction writers. Robots running the household, or exaggerated uses of virtual reality or artificial intelligence. I think that's the case because is much easier to talk about robots than deeper insights such as how will technologies and globalization impact emerging economies in Africa to bring new talent into the world or how will the social media dilemma -alluding to the documentary- come to a conclusion, meaning will we become mindless addicts or will there be policy changes and/or disruptive solutions.

This setup for the post can lead to multiple topics, like a multiverse branching off in many directions, but for the sake of today's mood I find myself in I wanted to focus on a simple perspective. All of these advancements create uncertainty. Not that this is uncommon in history there is always the uncertainty of the future, but rapid innovation and breaking from traditions means the floor beneath us is changing so rapidly that we can't often comprehend even how it will change. The perspective to this post is about what I think we should focus on as a society to cope and handle the uncertainty of the future we are moving forward.

Side note: did you know Elon Musk is seriously creating micro-chips that allow us to control technology in an almost telepathic way, and they are already testing it with chimps? Just wanted to make my point about how serious the uncertainty about the future is.

Uncertainty does not mean cluelessness. We have clues about the future, so first we need to understand what the most important clues about the future are and then plan accordingly to cope for them.

Clue number one tells us the world will continue to make technological advancements at insurmountable rates, changing the way we do health all the way to education. Jimmy ain't eating the world, software is.

Clue number two is that many jobs as we know them now will stop existing or be automated, seriously is like estimated xx% of jobs to be automated, and we don't know a lot about what type of jobs or skills are needed in the future workforce.

Clue number three tells us that the world has been and will continue to be a constant trade-off. Innovation means advancement for some and downfall for others, it is always a tradeoff. Uber or AirBnB was disrupted in many ways positively but for some, it meant the loss of job security, a trend towards a gig-itized economy, and a bunch of other stuff. Disruption is good and bad depends where you stand. This clue about the past is an insight into the future, that with further disruptions there will be tradeoffs and it'd be nice to be on the right side.

There are other clues that I probably missed about the future, most definitely actually. Yet these are maybe enough (leave some in the comments if you think of any) to make the point.

Within these clues of the future, there is a lot of uncertainty created for individuals and therefore society as a whole about our place. Yet with these clues, we can sort of start to see a plan that needs to be created to prepare individually and as a society for this uncertainty. There are two major ideas that need to change, be innovated and disrupted, growth and evolve in order to tackle the uncertainty of the future. Education and policy.

# Number one is education.

Education needs innovating, everyone knows that. Yet, what it needs first and foremost is a change in goal. Education from first grade to sixteenth was created to integrate into individual societal norms, productive processes, and appropriate knowledge. I think about it like this: if I wanted to create software to keep my accounting, I program it accordingly powered simply by writing code to perform the right processes using the right data/information. That's what schools were designed for, to program individuals to do the right processes and have the right information that could eventually once 'graduated' help the economy grow. It was and is in many ways training. A lot of the time even the knowledge itself is 'useless' in terms of its applicability to the economic sector in which the graduate goes on to work for but it is the process and habits that stick to make this graduate a good employee.

That's not going to work any longer. Traditional values such as blind patriotism, religious belief tied to the government, belief in the competence of the government, and systems themselves are all slowly deteriorating. That's the sort of thing Arendt among other thinkers said a while back. With these traditional values slowly withering, and innovation disrupting at such a speed that everything in our lives is a little uncertain, even deeper things such as what our purpose in life is, the education system is destined to fail students. It is not that nobody who comes out of this system is going to be successful obviously, it is that the system itself is not designed to help everyone have the best chance at being successful in the current (and future) world.

You don't need the whole tale about how education has not changed in over 1 billion years. Innovating schools also does not mean simply buying more computers. That's like brick and mortar store buying a computer for their employees while not changing their entire business model, not creating an entirely new model for selling to their customers online.

It is a bit silly to think schools haven't changed, and ineffective governments, bureaucracy, and financial interests are part of it as well as the delicacy of the matter in it itself considering how important schools are and how parents view good vs bad schooling. Tradition holds strong here, even though there are many amazing theories for innovating schooling to be more impactful than knowledge absorption. Knowledge absorption might be done by a simple chip in the head fifty years from now, so it is clear that we need to reach beyond that. How to ask the right questions, and how to think in a given context. We can learn math but with math being the least important part of the lesson, and with logic being the real takeaway. Some schools and systems around the world are changing their educational goals and methods, which is existing whether they all are working or not that matters, simply because that's what innovation is: a risky change worth making for a greater reward.

At an individual change, it means to vehemently seek learning opportunities at every turn and not get sucked up into a specialist role with a narrow perspective. Not that you can't work as a specialist, just that you always seek to expand your horizon. The internet is making it easier and more accessible to learn about almost anything. There is room for more no doubt, in terms of improving how we access the information so is not just a void we get lost in, but there is a lot out there. As individuals, we can become lifelong learners focused on expanding what we learn and really honing in on becoming good learners above all else. How do you become a good learner? You keep learning as if it were the practicing of a free throw.

# Number two is policy. 

Automation will grow exponentially, and those on the wrong side of the trade-off will suffer. Modern policy must be prepared to deal with such uncertainty by focusing on creating a safety net for modern citizens. That's far from a socialist perspective now, it is simply in my view the logical next step given the rate at which we are innovating through our capitalist enterprises. 

There is a reason Universal Income is being discussed by the real giants of tomorrow, the Facebooks and Googles. It is almost undeniable that as we continue to innovate and grow our economic capacity to supply, many people who were on the wrong side of that innovation wave will be left behind without any economic capacity to demand. They will be left behind for good if our education system doesn't change and allow them to be more transferable learners. Either way, people need to be able to transition and not succumb to poverty due to uncertainty. Economic policies that are ambitious and design for the future instead of sending us back into the past need to be put forward.

There will need to be some policies, to a much greater debate in terms of to what extent, that regulate and ensure the innovative initiatives we put forth are truly beneficial to our society and not left to be detrimental instead. 

It is hard to see Facebook become Meta, and not be both excited and terrified at the same time. The idea for a metaverse by Facebook seems immaculate and a real achievement by humanity, which I am sure many other innovators will do even greater things. However, to think of Facebook's current products and their detriment to our society in terms of mental health, dissemination of falsehood, data control, etc. makes this innovation a bit scary too. Policies need to be aligned to protect citizens against the 'side-effects' of innovative solutions. Also, maybe we need more engineers, AI ethicists, technologists, etc. being part of these policy discussions and running for political positions.

As an individual, I could find the most innovative government with policies that truly allow for innovation while regulating its practices enough to prevent damages and just move there. Another solution, more plausible, would be to be active in discussions and informed in order to further the awareness of how important this will be to our futures. We can shape policy if we are active enough, and that policy could shape our lives and future generations' lives to be less uncertain.
