Hi 👋🏽 thank you for joining me in my personal rant space. Thanks to my involvement in open-source I learned how powerful those principles can be when applied everywhere. That's what this is, and open-sourcing of my brain and it's intricate throughts to hopefully recieve your feedback and create a loop of learning for both of us. I intend on writing about things that cause me headaches and tear the very existing of my being into question ... that way maybe the most it'll do to you is cause you a stomach ache.

I spend my time if not writing here or reading somewhere else, working on Flipped. Flipped is the harnessing of open-source and decentralized power to innovate how we learn. We follow our own theory informed in other theories, we call it collective learning.

I am interested in writing fiction, emerging technologies, decentralized and open-source solutions, as well as ScFi like concepts and how they can teach us something of our everyday existance. 

Cheers 🤪
